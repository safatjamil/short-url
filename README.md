This is a django based project that creates short/tiny urls. Organizations can have their short alias in the url. 
For example, your organization's name is **Shopify** and you want to have the alias **SPFY** in every shot url you generate.
It generates a short url for a lengthy url of your website and it will look like **host.com/SPFY-h9Ok2** or **host.com/SPFY-Ld5Pc**. The alias SPFY represents your business and let the users predict where they are going to be redirected. The main purpose of this project is to generate short urls with the organization's own branding.

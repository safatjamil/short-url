This is a django based project that creates short/tiny urls. Organizations can have their short alias in the url. 
For example, your organization's name is Shopify and you want to have the alias SPFY in every shot url you generate.
You can generate a short url for a lengthy url of your website and it will be host.com/SPFY-h9Ok2 or host.com/SPFY-Ld5Pc. The main purpose of this project is to generate  
a short url that represents your business.
